# Python-Webcam-Motion-Detector-Project


Webcam Motion Detector

Main language: Python 

Libraries: OpenCV, Pandas, NumPy


Description
This a webcam motion detector script created to detect any motion through the webcam, while the script is running a time stamp is recorded each time an object enters and leaves the frame. Once the script is stopped a Comma-Separated Value file (CSV) is generated to that provides data on each occurrences of the object entering and leaving the frame along with the time and date stamp. The data in current CSV file reflects the last time the script was ran. 
Future enhancement:
I look to update the script to provide better stability within the frame in detecting the objects. I also would like to add a geo location to the data set.

To Run:
You will need to open your local command line and have the python programming language already install in your local computer. I would also recommend crating a virtual environment to run the script. You will need to install the pip pack manger, once you have done that be sure to you have installed the OpenCV, Pandas, and NumPy libraries. All of this can be done through the command line.

Please provide any advice or suggestion in improving code.

Thank You
